# Eliza

Eliza is a mock Rogerian psychotherapist. Original program by Joseph Weizenbaum.

ELIZA is a natural language conversation program described by Joseph Weizenbaum in January 1966. It features the dialog between a human user and a computer program representing a mock Rogerian psychotherapist.
The original program was implemented on the IBM 7094 of the Project MAC time-sharing system at MIT and was written in MAD-SLIP. For more information visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA

For a conversation example given by Joseph Weizenbaum in his article see the Eliza Test page. (http://www.masswerk.at/elizabot/eliza_test.html)

This is an implementation based on the promised based node.js module https://github.com/natelewis/eliza-as-promised.

Eliza is very discreet and doesn't memorize or log anything you say. But be aware making use of internet implies your message is traveling thru the cloud. Although all companies care about your privacy it could be your conversation is logged somewhere.
